## Reporting a Vulnerability

**Do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, report them via:

1. **Email**: security@reposell.dev
2. **GitHub Security Advisories**: Use the "Report a vulnerability" tab on GitHub

We will acknowledge receipt within 48 hours and provide a detailed response within 7 days.

## Security Requirements

The reposell CLI implements the following security measures:

### Cryptographic Security
- Ed25519 for all signing operations
- Private keys NEVER committed to Git, npm, CI artifacts, or logs
- Key rotation via signed trust documents
- Signature verification for all manifests and pricing policies

### Payment Security
- Stripe webhook signature verification (mandatory)
- Never trust payment confirmation from browser
- Authoritative payment state from payment provider only
- Idempotent webhook processing

### Git Provider Security
- Minimal GitHub OAuth scopes
- Webhook signature verification
- Token storage via secure OS keychain

### CLI Security
- Input validation on all user-provided data
- Output validation on generated manifests
- No secret logging
- Secure default file permissions

### Dependency Security
- `bun audit` in CI
- Pinned dependency versions
- Regular dependency updates
