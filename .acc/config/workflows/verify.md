# verify.md — CI Verification (MUST PASS for deployment)

This workflow MUST pass on every deployment. It enforces the runtime trust enforcement
policy for the official listing and any public listings.

## Verification Steps

1. **Fetch official trust metadata** from `https://reposell.dev/trust.json`
2. **Verify official signatures** (Ed25519) on trust document
3. **Fetch pricing policy** from `https://reposell.dev/pricing.json`
4. **Verify pricing-policy signature** using trust document keys
5. **Validate pricing policy** (fees, percentages, accounting test)
6. **Verify listing identity** (match registered listing_id)
7. **Validate listing registration** (active status, correct endpoint)
8. **Validate protocol compatibility** (version match)
9. **Run application tests** (critical user flows)
9. **Build** (typecheck, lint, build)
10. **Deploy** - ONLY if all above pass

## Safe State Enforcement

If ANY verification step fails:
- **Deployment MUST FAIL** - no automatic fallback
- **Runtime MUST enter safe state** on startup if policy cannot be validated
- **NO fallback percentages** (e.g., MUST NOT assume 50/50)
- **NO silently continuing with stale or invalid trust data**
- **Alert operator immediately** via logs

## Accounting Test (Mandatory)

**Note:** Community referral economics are not yet implemented. The Main/Public listing splits are reserved for future use. Currently, the listing fee goes entirely to reposell.

For a $50 product with $5 fee and 50/50 split (future — when community listings are supported):
- Repository owner: $45
- Main listing: $2.50
- Public listing: $2.50

All listing implementations MUST pass this test at unit, integration, API, and E2E levels.
